# 8-Puzzle_Solver
This is a project from an introductory artificial intelligence course, meant to exhibit use of the A* and Local Beam
search methods. In particular, this code can generate a randomized 8-puzzle and then use one of those search methods to 
find the shortest path of moves to solve it, which it then displays.

I have included as a Word document the accompanying writeup for the project, which contains much of my thought process
during writing and debugging.
